# MP4 to Text Converter ðŸŽ¬

Simple tool which lets you paste an mp4 file into a directory, extracts the transcript from the mp4 file, lints the grammar of the text, then outputs it in a .txt file.

Uses Google's Gemini API to format the video's transcript in human readable english, with corresponding paragraphs, syntax and spacing.

## Setup

- Need to create a Gemini API Key which can be done by following the steps [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)
- Create a new environment variable in your .env called GEMINI_API_KEY with your corresponding API key.
- Once setup, all you need to do is paste your mp4 files into the "IN" directory. The corresponding txt file will be outputted in the "OUT" directory.
- Text will be automatically copied to your clipboard once ran successfully (only works when processing single file)
